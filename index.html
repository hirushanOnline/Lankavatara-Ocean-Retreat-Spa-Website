                            <p>Lankavatara Ocean Retreat is an ecologically friendly hotel which comfort means no unwanted impact on the environment. Most of 15 spacious suits (about 46 square meters) offers a breathtaking view of the Indian Ocean. Just to tell you that we made sure to keep in place all the coconut palms and other trees and shrubs while building it. </p>
                            <p>
                                Designed by Kremnev Atelier studio Lankavatara ocean retreat pays homage to the best thing that the island can offer: its natural material. Our interiors are deliberately minimalistic and carefully studied for comfort and details. Lack of distractions allows you to enjoy what surrounds you, that is, the pristine nature around. Kalametiya is a small fishing village and a bird reserve of the same name. It is located 214 km south from Colombo and 15 km from Tangalle. The nature is stunningly beautiful here and we tried to harmoniously fit in it our hotel offering a high level of comfort and sophistication. </p>
